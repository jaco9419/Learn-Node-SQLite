# Learn-Node-SQLite
Codecademy's excercises to practice Node JS and SQLite and retrieve data.
You can check out the code all you want. This is what each app.js file does:

**app1.js** Retrieves the whole database.

**app2.js** Retrieves only one row.

**app3.js** Uses Placeholders.

**app4.js** Uses db.run() and handles erros.

Note: db.sqlite is empty
